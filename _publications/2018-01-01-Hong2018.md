excerpt: There is a growing interest in developing Total Site Heat Integration methods, since Total Site Heat Integration offers an energy-saving opportunity across multiple plants beyond the traditional intra-plant plant integration. Total Site heat integration can be achieved indirectly by non-isothermal utility loop, such as hot water and thermal oil. The parameters of non-isothermal utility loop, interconnectivity patterns directly determine the energy saving and the capital cost. In this work, a transshipment type Total Site heat exchanger network (HEN) model using non-isothermal utility loop is developed. A new representation method of non-isothermal utility loop is proposed based on transshipment type HEN model to avoid non-linear terms. The model is formulated as a MINLP problem with all linear constraints. The operating cost, capital cost of heat exchangers, pumping and piping cost are holistically considered and optimized. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.
