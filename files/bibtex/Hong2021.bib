	abstract = {Hydrogen is a promising low carbon fuel option with geographically distributed production and consumption. Hence, its regional and global hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) are vital for the potential future energy markets. We present a holistic study of various options for transporting (not producing) hydrogen from both techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The infrastructure and energy requirements of four options for transporting hydrogen between export and import terminals, namely methyl cyclohexane, liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, and liquid ammonia, are analyzed in detail. These are compared for HSC energy penalty, carbon avoidance and landed cost of hydrogen under different scenarios. A case study is also presented to capture the perspectives of an importer. The preferred transport mode depends on export location and end use. For Singapore's power sector, compressed hydrogen from the neighbors via pipelines is most favorable with a carbon avoidance of 54â€“59% at 0.3 $/kg CO2 avoided.},
