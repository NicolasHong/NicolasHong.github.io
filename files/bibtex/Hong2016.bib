	abstract = {This paper presented a novel mathematical programming model for the simultaneous optimization of heat integrated water allocation networks featuring parallel heat exchanger network (HEN) structure. In the HEN structure, both freshwater and wastewater can be split freely. This model was suitable for both uniform wastewater treatment and separate wastewater treatment cases. The proposed model was formulated as a MINLP (mixed-integer non-linear programming) problem, making it applicable to large scale problems. The main objective was to minimize the total annual cost. Three literature examples, including a large scale example, were illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the model. It was shown that the proposed method was as accurate as the literature methods for small scale problems, but performed better for large scale problem applications.},
