	abstract = {The integrated design of the heat exchanger network (HEN) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system with new working fluids is a complex optimization problem. It involves navigating a vast design space across working fluid molecules, ORC processes, and networks. In this article, a new two-stage reverse strategy is developed. The optimal HEN-ORC configurations and operating conditions, and the thermodynamic properties of the hypothetical working fluid are identified by an equation of state (EOS) free HEN-ORC model in the first stage. With two developed group contribution-artificial neural network thermodynamic property prediction models, working fluid molecules are screened out in the second stage from a database containing more than 430,000 hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). The presented method is employed in two cases, where new working fluids are found. The total annual cost of Case 1 is 12\%–22\% lower than the literature, and the power output of Case 2 is 5\%–8\% higher than the literature.},
