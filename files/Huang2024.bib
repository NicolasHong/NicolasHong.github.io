	abstract = {Refineries face increasing hydrogen demand due to the consumption of heavy and sour crude oil. This study presents a novel hybrid method to optimize hydrogen network configurations with a rigorous pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process model. This method utilizes Bayesian optimization to address the upper-level unknown constraints black-box optimization problem while employing deterministic algorithms to manage the lower-level nonlinear programming problem. Furthermore, infeasible regions are transformed into feasible ones by introducing a dummy stream, and the costs incurred during the transformation process are accurately calculated. The proposed method is validated using two literature cases. In Case 1, Bayesian optimization outperformed the Kriging model, resulting in a 7.84\% reduction in total annual cost (TAC). In Case 2, a comparison of four search strategies revealed the developed two-phase strategy as the most effective one. This method offers a powerful and practical tool for optimizing real-world hydrogen networks with PSA processes.},
